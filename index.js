// File Overview: index.js
// What this file is: Runtime bootstrap file that registers App as the root component.
// When this runs: Loaded when this module is imported by a screen/service.
// Main inputs: React state/props, Firebase data, and shared modules.
// Main outputs: UI rendering and/or side effects (navigation, reads/writes, audio).
// Read this first: Start from the main exported component/function, then follow hooks/callbacks in order.

import { registerRootComponent } from 'expo';

import App from './App';

// registerRootComponent calls AppRegistry.registerComponent('main', () => App);
// It also ensures that whether you load the app in Expo Go or in a native build,
// the environment is set up appropriately
registerRootComponent(App);
